# transform(font);
(((this description is not updated yet)))

transform(font); is an open source web application for generating fonts. Based on several parameters you can easily modify and download a large range of generative font families with little effort.

transform(font); uses the P5jsSVG library to have direct access to font paths through their SVG code for maximum possibilities of generativity. To create a working font file, it uses the opentype.js library to convert the SVG code to an OTF typeface.
